# Toyhouse Character Template

This code is an html / css character template for Toyhou.se. I am intending to use this as a template for further designs. As of 12/19 the basic template is done and prepared for Esokey, a character I am still working on. However I am going to blank out the name and make a few more templates based on this design.

As of 1/15/22, project is cancelled as it does not work as intended using the software of the website. That, and I didn't really account for a whole ton of different problems that come along with building up a template like this for an external wesbite...

Oh well!

## Tech Specs

I don't currently have anything special in this code. There is no javascript, only straight html and css as toyhouse is a little limited in terms of customization. That being said, I have a few ideas for future development.

* Javascript page generation. This will take this template and inject information into the correct boxes within the html. It wouldn't be too difficult I think, but if I do this
* I want to use sass to simplify the css
* Potentially play with bootstrap?

## Future project ideas

* profile template for toyhouse
* uhhhhh....
